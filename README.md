# Radar Launch API

Handles backend measures for the [Radar Launch](https://launch.radardao.xyz)

The frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/RadarDAO-xyz/radar-launch-frontend/).

## Quick Start

You can start the application locally using

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will host it on ports `:80` and `:443`.

### Updating your hosts file
> Your hosts file is located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

Open your hosts file and append `127.0.0.1 api.radardao.xyz` to it. This will allow live backend testing using the actual prod frontend.

To undo the change and use actual prod backend, delete the added line.
